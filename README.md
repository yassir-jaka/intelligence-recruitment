Application 

Given the permanent need of the company for the recruitment of
new employees, as well as the increase in the number of
postulants; Human Resources managers meet
problems in recruitment. In order to lighten this task
which weighs on these, we saw the relevance of introducing a
Bot chat that would be setup to ask some questions. So, it
can conduct pre-selection job interviews with
candidates and ask them all kinds of questions that are
generally appreciated by the Human Resources Manager.
With the answers provided by the candidates, the chatbot can
find those who are most competent for the job.
For this, the chatbot analyzes the keywords of the query and can
answer using pre-recorded answers. The candidates
selected can then have a job interview with
a real recruiter.

In the field of Human Resource, the chatbot can
automate the recruitment process. Indeed, it is a tool
adequate to carry out the first stage of selection of candidates in
analyzing their curriculum vitae and cover letter. he can
also carry out a questionnaire of use with questions
simple type "Can you present your course? ". this
pre-selection process eliminates irrelevant applications and
save valuable time for recruiters.

In this project ,as first approach the chatbot will just be used to computer science feild related jobs , for the incoming developement ,we'll try to generalize it to the rest of feilds and make it easier to be implemented in web server .

This project is still just a try to see how relevant this chat bot could be using Watson technologie .
